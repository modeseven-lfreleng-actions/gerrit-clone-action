"""Keeping the tool's own files out of a checkout's ``git status``.

A run writes files into its output path: ``refresh`` its log and
manifest, and any filtering run the tree's intent.  When that path is a
working copy's top level, git reports those files as untracked changes
there, and refresh skips a working copy with uncommitted changes -- so
it would never update the one checkout it was pointed at.

They are listed in the checkout's ``info/exclude`` instead.  That file
belongs to the clone alone: nothing is committed, and the checkout's own
``.gitignore`` stays as it was.  It only hides untracked files, so a
change to a file git tracks still counts -- and a run refuses to start
rather than overwrite a tracked file that has one of its names.
