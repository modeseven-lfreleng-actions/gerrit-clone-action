    For bare clones (created by ``git clone --mirror``), this reads the

    the default branch on the GitHub repository via the API.

    **Gerrit parent projects** (HEAD → ``refs/meta/config`` with no
    ``refs/heads/*`` branches) are detected and logged at INFO level
    rather than treated as errors.  These are organisational
    containers in the Gerrit hierarchy and will always appear empty
    on GitHub.

    When HEAD points to a non-branch ref (e.g. ``refs/meta/config``)
    but the repository *does* contain ``refs/heads/*`` branches, the
    function falls back to the first available branch (preferring
    ``master`` or ``main``).

    cause the mirror to be marked as failed.
