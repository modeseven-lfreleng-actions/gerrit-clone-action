"""Git execution environment and remote handling for refresh operations.

Bottom layer of the :class:`~gerrit_clone.refresh_worker.RefreshWorker` mixin
stack. It answers three related questions about *how* we talk to a remote:
which URL is configured, whether that URL implies an SSH handshake (and so
needs pacing), and what environment git subprocesses should run with.

Every higher layer that performs a network operation depends on the handshake
jitter provided here, and launches its git commands through :func:`run_git`.
