"""Local repository discovery and project filtering for bulk refreshes.

Answers the question "which repositories should this refresh touch?" — walking
a directory tree for Git repositories, working copies and bare mirrors alike,
and then applying the include/exclude project patterns. Kept separate from
:mod:`gerrit_clone.refresh_manager` because selection is purely a filesystem
and pattern-matching concern with no bearing on how repositories are then
refreshed.
