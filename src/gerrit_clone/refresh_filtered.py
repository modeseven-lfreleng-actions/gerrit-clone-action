"""Refreshing a repository that content filtering has rewritten.

Refreshing one brings the original history back: a mirror's
``+refs/*:refs/*`` fetch forces every upstream ref over the rewritten
one, removed files and redacted secrets included.  So such a repository
is refreshed only by a run whose filters cover the policy it was filtered
under (see :mod:`gerrit_clone.content_policy`), and then only as a staged
transaction: the mirror is copied, the copy is fetched and filtered, and
its refs reach the mirror only once all of that has succeeded.  A fetch
or filter that fails leaves the mirror exactly as it was.

A working copy is refreshed through a filtered copy too, once it has
been prepared as any working copy is: see
:mod:`gerrit_clone.refresh_checkout_stage`.  Here it meets the same
refusals as a mirror, and one more: filtered where it stands, it has
lost the remote-tracking branch a refresh follows, and is refused.
