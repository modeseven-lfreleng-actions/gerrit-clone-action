"""Guarded Rich imports shared by the progress modules.

The drawing code checks ``RICH_AVAILABLE`` before constructing any Rich
widget and falls back to plain text when it is false. Performing that
guarded import once, here, keeps the decision in a single place instead
of repeating it in every module that draws something, and keeps
``RICH_AVAILABLE`` consistent across them.

The guard covers the drawing code alone. Rich is a declared, hard
dependency and several other modules -- ``gerrit_clone.logging`` among
them -- import it unguarded, so the package as a whole still requires
it. Reconciling that is worth doing, but not in a refactor.

The ``TYPE_CHECKING`` branch binds the same names unconditionally. A
type checker cannot know the import succeeded, so without it every use
site reads as possibly unbound; at runtime only the guarded branch below
ever executes.
