    """Filter projects using include/exclude patterns with wildcard support.

    Include patterns use hierarchical matching — a plain name like ``ccsdk``
    matches both the exact project ``ccsdk`` *and* any child such as
    ``ccsdk/apps``.  Shell-style wildcards (``*``, ``?``, ``[seq]``) are
    also supported (e.g. ``*sdk*`` matches ``ccsdk`` and ``pythonsdk-tests``).

    Exclude patterns are applied **after** inclusion and use the same
    matching rules.  A project that matches any exclude pattern is removed
    regardless of whether it matched an include pattern.

    Args:
        projects: List of all projects.
        filter_names: List of project name patterns to include.
            An empty list means "include everything".
        exclude_patterns: Optional list of project name patterns to exclude.

    Returns:
        Filtered list of projects.
