"""Tracked launch of a child whose output is read as it arrives.

:func:`~gerrit_clone.subprocess_tracking.run_tracked` holds its child's
whole output until it exits, which a secret scan cannot afford: ``git
log -p`` over a full history is read line by line instead.  This starts
the child the same way -- refused once its batch is abandoned, in its
own process group, registered so that an abandon stops that group --
and leaves the reading to the caller.

It goes through the tracker's private launch path rather than a copy of
it.  The abandon check, the launch and the registration have to stay a
single step under the tracker's lock, run on its launcher thread, and a
second implementation of that step could drift from the first.
