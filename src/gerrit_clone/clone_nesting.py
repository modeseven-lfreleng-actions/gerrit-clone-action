"""Nested (parent/child) repository support for clone operations.

Gerrit hierarchies routinely contain projects such as ``foo`` and ``foo/bar``,
which map onto a git working tree nested inside another git working tree.  This
module owns the two concerns that arise from that:

* locating the git ancestor a project would be nested under, and
* keeping the parent repository's ``.git/info/exclude`` up to date so the child
  does not show up as untracked content in its parent.

Batch-level bookkeeping for how much nesting was detected stays with the
caller: :class:`~gerrit_clone.clone_orchestrator.CloneManager` owns the sets
and :func:`~gerrit_clone.clone_ordering.log_nested_summary` reports them.
