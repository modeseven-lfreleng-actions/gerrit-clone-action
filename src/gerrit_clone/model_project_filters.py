"""Project name pattern matching and include/exclude filtering.

Leaf module implementing the pattern syntax shared by the ``--include`` and
``--exclude`` options: shell-style wildcards plus plain hierarchical prefix
matching. Kept free of runtime package imports so configuration and discovery
modules may depend on it.

    Patterns may contain shell-style wildcards (``*``, ``?``, ``[seq]``,

    Additionally, **hierarchical matching** is applied for patterns that
