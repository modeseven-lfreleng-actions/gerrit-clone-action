"""Running the secret scan's ``git log`` with every wait bounded.

Stopping git's whole process group normally ends the scan: its pipes
close, the readers reach EOF and git is reaped.  A process can outlive
even SIGKILL, though -- stuck in uninterruptible I/O -- and one holding
a pipe would leave the stdout read, the wait for git, or the stderr
drain blocked for good.  So the stdout read runs on a thread of its own
too, and every wait here has a deadline; whatever outlives it is given
up on, with a warning, and the scan fails closed.

The pipes of such a process are left open rather than closed: a thread
blocked reading one holds the buffer's lock, so closing it would block
too, and closing the descriptor underneath would let a reused number
feed the stuck reader some other file.
