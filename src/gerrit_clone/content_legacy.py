"""Recognising a repository an earlier release content-filtered.

Releases before :mod:`gerrit_clone.content_policy` existed filtered
repositories without recording which filters they applied.  Nothing
can show that a refresh re-applies filters nobody recorded, so such a
repository has to be refused one -- and to be recognised, it has to be
recognised by what those releases left behind:

- ``git filter-repo`` leaves its ``filter-repo/`` metadata directory in
  the git directory, with a ``commit-map`` once it has rewritten
  anything: ``--analyze`` creates the directory too, but rewrites
  nothing.  It also removes every remote, but a remote added back, or
  one not named ``origin``, would fetch the original history.
- Without ``git filter-repo`` installed, which no release declared as a
  dependency, ``--remove-files`` committed the removal on every branch
  instead, keeping ``origin`` and its ``+refs/*:refs/*`` refspec: one
  fetch puts the removed files back at every tip.

This release leaves the same traces when it filters, so a repository
whose filters are recorded carries a stamp saying so, and is never
inspected for them.
