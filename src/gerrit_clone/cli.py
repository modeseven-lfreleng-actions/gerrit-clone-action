"""Typer-based CLI for gerrit-clone tool.

This module is the public entry point for the command line interface.  It
assembles the Typer application by importing every command module and
re-exports the collaborators that the command bodies resolve at call time, so
that ``gerrit_clone.cli.<name>`` remains the single place to substitute them.
