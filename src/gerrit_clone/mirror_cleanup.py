"""Removal of pre-existing local clone directories before a mirror run.

Provides the path selection and reporting around the deletion loop; the
deletion itself stays with the mirror manager.

A repository that a release up to v2.2.4 content-filtered, and any
directory holding one, is held back from the whole batch.  Those releases
recorded no filters, so neither the tree's intent nor this run can
re-apply them: cloned again, it would be pushed with ``git push --mirror``
unfiltered, and even as it stands ``--recreate`` would replace its GitHub
repository with it.  It is left alone until the operator deletes it and
clones it again with the filters it needs.
