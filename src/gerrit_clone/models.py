        then caps at 32. For other systems, use heuristic cpu_count * 4.

        For Gerrit (SSH) sources, the dynamically calculated default is then
        halved (floor of 1) to reduce the risk of overwhelming a Gerrit
        server's SSH front-end with too many concurrent handshakes. Bursts of
        parallel SSH connections are frequently throttled by Gerrit and
        surface as transient "Could not read from remote repository"
        failures. The halved value is additionally capped at
        ``_MAX_GERRIT_THREADS`` since the binding constraint is the server's
        per-user SSH connection limit rather than local CPU. Users who want a
        different concurrency can still pass ``--threads`` explicitly.

        For GitHub sources the halving does not apply; instead a 2x multiplier
        is used since operations are network-limited rather than
        CPU/filesystem-limited. This optimization typically halves clone time
        for GitHub repositories (e.g., 10 cores -> 20 threads for GitHub,
        max 64 threads vs 16 halved for Gerrit).
