"""Keeping a content-filtered repository fetchable, and never pushable.

``git filter-repo`` removes the ``origin`` remote whenever it rewrites
history, so that the rewritten history is not pushed back over the
original by mistake.  For a mirror that is also the only record of where
it came from: without ``remote.origin.fetch`` a later refresh has nothing
to fetch, and skips the repository from then on.

So what fetching needs -- the URL and the fetch refspecs -- is put back,
and filter-repo's protection is kept by pointing pushes nowhere.  That
protection is extended to every remote, not only ``origin``: a mirror
cloned with ``--origin upstream`` keeps its source remote through the
rewrite, and filter-repo does nothing to stop a push to it.
``remote.<name>.mirror`` is left alone; with nowhere to push to, it no
longer matters.

Which filters rewrote a repository, and so what may refresh it, is
:mod:`gerrit_clone.content_policy`'s concern.
