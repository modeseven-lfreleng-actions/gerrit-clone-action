"""The tree's journal of content-filtering rewrites.

The intent (:mod:`gerrit_clone.content_intent`) records what was decided
for a tree.  This records the runs that carried it out:
``<tree>/.gerrit-clone/filter-journal.jsonl`` gets one JSON line before
each rewrite starts and another once it ends.  The start names the
command and release, the project and repository, the method --
``git filter-repo`` or the worktree fallback -- the filters, and a digest
of every ref, and the remotes it fetches from, without credentials; the
end says whether the rewrite worked, with the digest of the refs it
left.  Like the intent, it holds a token's digest only.

It is an audit trail, with one exception: a start without a successful
end.  A crash, or a rewrite that failed part-way, may have left the
repository partly rewritten, so its filters stay in force -- added to
the intent at the next run -- until a later rewrite of the same project
completes under filters that cover them.

A start is written, and flushed to disk, before the rewrite begins; if it
cannot be, the repository is not filtered.  Appends take the intent's
lock, so a line from one process never lands inside another's.  A last
line a crash cut short is a start or an end whose rewrite never began or
whose start already counts, so readers skip it and the next append
removes it.  Any other line that cannot be understood stops the run, as
an unreadable intent does.  The journal is never written through a
symbolic link, which a checkout could track to aim it outside the tree.
