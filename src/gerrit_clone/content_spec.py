"""The content filters a run applies, decided per repository.

Two sources, combined: the run's own ``--remove-files``, ``--git-filter``
and ``--redact-secrets`` options, and the tree's recorded intent
(:mod:`gerrit_clone.content_intent`) -- so a run without the options
still filters as the tree was filtered before, and one with them only
ever adds.  Removal patterns and secret redaction come from either.
Tokens come only from the options, since the intent keeps digests alone:
a project whose intent replaces a token the run does not supply cannot
be filtered as decided, and :meth:`ContentFilterSpec.missing_tokens`
says so for the caller to refuse it.
