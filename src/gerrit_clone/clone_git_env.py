Owns how a project is addressed as a git URL and the environment the clone
subprocess runs in.  Many clone workers run concurrently against the same
machine, so each one is given a private ``HOME`` and git config.  Without that
isolation the workers contend on the user's global ``.gitconfig`` and produce
spurious "could not lock config file" failures.
