"""Indirection for the git ref helpers used by mirror branch handling.

The mirror manager reads branch state from local clones through a
:class:`GitRefInspector` rather than importing the ``git_utils``
helpers directly into every collaborating module.  The manager builds
the inspector from its own module globals at call time, which keeps a
single, patchable definition site for these helpers while still
allowing the branch logic itself to live outside ``mirror_manager``.
