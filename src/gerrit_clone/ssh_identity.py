"""Validation for the SSH identity file setting.

``GERRIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`` (and ``--ssh-identity-file``) take a *path*,
but the name invites passing the key material itself, as CI secrets
usually hold it.  Default path validation then echoes the value in its
error, and that output is re-wrapped, so a CI runner's secret masking
can miss parts of the key.  These helpers recognise key content and
reject it with a message that never includes the value.
